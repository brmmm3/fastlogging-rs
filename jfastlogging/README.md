# `jfastlogging`

This is the Java layer for [fastlogging](https://github.com/brmmm3/fastlogging-rs/tree/master/fastlogging). This package is for creating a Java extension class using [jni](https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs).

Follow the guide to create a Java extension [here](https://docs.rs/jni/latest/jni).

Please notice the **naming convention**, which is very important here.

Run `make` to compile the Java extension.
